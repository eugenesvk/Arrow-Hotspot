Arrow•Hotspot mouse cursor theme for Windows
<br>
avoids unnecessary changes in shapes (no hands, circles) and always marks the hotspot
</p>

## Introduction

Big triangle-shaped 🮰 arrow without pointless tail and a tiny red dot for the hotspot•, used for most of the basic forms:

  - ![link](./img/BlueTip_48·48_32𝑏.png) links    : signal less obtrusively with a change of tip color as it's often already obvious that you can click a link without the whole extra noise of changing the mouse pointer
  - work/busy: signal less obtrusively with a red filler color, which is especially useful when the work only lasts a fraction of a second, so doesn't warrant a "bigger" signal of changing to a different pointer shape.<br/>
    - ![busy](./img/Busy_red_fill↕_48·48_32𝑏.png) "busy foreground" state is signalled by the whole cursor becoming red 
    - ![work](./img/Work_red_band_top½↕_48·48_32𝑏.png) "work in the background" state is signalled by a red band moving at the top ½ of the arrow 
  - ![Help](./img/Help⸮_48·48_32𝑏.png) help: just add a `?` mark inside the cursor
  - ![Pin](./img/Pin_blue_tip_48·48_32𝑏.png) ![People](./img/People_blue_tip_48·48_32𝑏.png) pin/people: attach extra symbols to the click-signalling-color-tipped arrow for the same reason and for consistency

![Text_white](./img/⌶Text_28·48_24𝑏_white.png) ![Text_black](./img/⌶Text_28·48_24𝑏_black.png) ⌶ Text : inverted ¦ with a middle gap and a red middle hotspot• dot to indicate position without obscuring text

Others: Added red dot/cross for the hotspot• ![Resize](./img/Resiz_48·48_32𝑏.png)
